## Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis

### 1. Drivers of Financial Inclusion
Digital infrastructure (4G coverage, mobile network expansion), mobile money platforms (Telebirr, M-Pesa, EthioPay), and digital ID coverage (FAYDA) are the main drivers of financial inclusion in Ethiopia. Regulatory policies and market competition also support adoption, particularly in urban areas.

### 2. Account Ownership Stagnation
Despite over 65M mobile money accounts, account ownership growth slowed to only +3pp. Many accounts are inactive or duplicate registrations, and structural barriers like gender gaps, limited rural connectivity, and low digital literacy constrain meaningful adoption.

### 3. Gender Gap Evolution
The gender gap in both account ownership and usage remains persistent. Men consistently have higher access and usage rates, and disaggregated data indicates minimal improvement over recent years, highlighting ongoing structural challenges for women’s financial inclusion.

### 4. Data Gaps
Sparse rural coverage, limited year-to-year observations, missing active user metrics, and incomplete infrastructure data limit the ability to analyze trends and causal relationships.

### 5. Hypotheses for Impact Modeling
- Digital ID rollout (FAYDA) increases account ownership with a 12–24 month lag.  
- Mobile money launches (Telebirr, M-Pesa) drive usage faster than access.  
- Reducing the gender gap would significantly boost overall financial inclusion.  
- Infrastructure investments (4G networks, ATMs) improve access but with delayed effects.
